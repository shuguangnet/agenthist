  doctor: `Usage:
  agenthist doctor [--agent <codex|claude|opencode|pi>]...

Inspect detected history sources without creating AgentHist state or reading chat bodies.
The default is every supported Agent.
`,
  scan: `Usage:
  agenthist scan [--agent <codex|claude|opencode|pi>]...

Copy detected native history into the local AgentHist history pool.
The default is every detected Agent; --agent is an optional filter.
`,
  history: `Usage:
  agenthist history
  agenthist history list [--agent <agent>]... [--view <active|archived|deleted|all>]
                         [--offset <count>] [--limit <count>]
  agenthist history search <query> [--agent <agent>]... [--view <view>]
                                   [--offset <count>] [--limit <count>]
  agenthist history show <session-ref>
  agenthist history rename <session-ref> --name <name>
  agenthist history tag <session-ref> (--add <tag>|--remove <tag>)...
  agenthist history archive|unarchive|delete|undelete <session-ref>

Running without a subcommand refreshes detected Agent history and opens an interactive browser
for previewing, continuing, and organizing one conversation. The explicit subcommands remain
non-interactive and read the current AgentHist snapshot. Organizing changes only AgentHist's
library overlay; it never modifies the Agent's native history. List/search default to active,
offset 0, and limit 50; limit may be at most 1000. Results report the current page,
remaining count, and next offset when another page exists.
`,
  resume: `Usage:
  agenthist resume
  agenthist resume --last [--agent <codex|claude|opencode|pi>]
  agenthist resume --session <session-ref> [--agent <agent>]

Refresh local history, choose one conversation, and continue it with any supported Agent.
The current workspace and its most recent conversations are shown first. Continuing with the
source Agent opens its native session directly; choosing another Agent runs the existing
conversion preflight and transactional import before opening it. --last skips conversation
selection, while --session is available for advanced use.
`,
  experience: `Usage:
  agenthist experience [--dry-run]
                       [--workspace <directory>]...
                       [--session <session-ref>]... [--all]
                       [--agent <agent>]... [--since <date>]
                       [--max-input-tokens <count>]
                       [--max-deep-input-tokens <count>]
                       [--request-input-tokens <count>]
                       [-o|--output <directory>]
  agenthist experience model check

The command builds or reuses the history evidence index. With no scope option it uses the current
directory as its workspace; repeat --workspace for several directory trees, repeat --session
for exact sessions, or use --all explicitly. Dry-run reports the bounded plan without model
configuration, output files, or network requests. A complete run uses the fast model for
evidence and the deep model for candidate organization, then writes review.md with candidates
and source material plus audit.md with unrouted evidence. Give that directory to any AI;
AgentHist does not accept, reject, store, or otherwise constrain the review result. Models can
run through a compatible Chat Completions endpoint or a supported local Agent CLI.
Model check sends no history.
`,
  skill: `Usage:
  agenthist skill install [--agent <codex|claude|opencode|pi>]... [--force]
  agenthist skill uninstall

Install the AgentHist usage Skill. The default is every supported Agent;
--agent is an optional filter. Reinstalling updates content managed by AgentHist.
An existing skill with the same name is preserved unless --force is given.

Uninstall removes AgentHist-managed copies from all supported locations. Custom content with the
same skill name is preserved.
`,
  export: `Usage:
  agenthist export [--all]
                   [--agent <agent>]... [--workspace <directory>]...
                   [--session <session-ref>]... [-o <file.agenthist>]
                   [--language <en|zh>]

Export a portable .agenthist file from scanned history. Bulk export includes every safely
migratable session and reports anything skipped. --agent and --workspace are optional bulk filters.
Workspace paths are resolved from the current directory and match scanned workspaces exactly.
An explicit --session selection is strict and fails if that session cannot be exported.
In a terminal, using no filters opens the export guide for browsing, previewing, selecting,
and confirming history after an incremental refresh. --all bypasses the guide. Scripts and
--json remain non-interactive and read the current AgentHist snapshot.
--language selects the initial guide language and is unavailable for direct export.
Existing output files are never overwritten.
`,
  inspect: `Usage:
  agenthist inspect [file.agenthist] [--agent <agent>]... [--session <session-ref>]...
                    [--limit <count>] [--cursor <cursor>]

Deeply validate an AgentHist file and show a bounded entry list without importing it.
In a terminal, omit the file to choose a .agenthist file from the current directory.
Each row identifies the source Agent. The workspace summary lists every source path so
cross-machine mappings can be prepared without opening native file metadata.
Filters and pagination affect presentation only; validation still covers the whole file.
The default limit is 50 and the maximum is 200.
`,
  import: `Usage:
  agenthist import [file.agenthist] [--dry-run|--apply]
                   [--agent <agent>]... [--session <session-ref>]...
                   [--to <agent>]
                   [--target <agent>=<path>]... [--map-path <source>=<target>]...
                   [--codex-provider <current|preserve|provider-id>]
                   [--language <en|zh>]

Import every file entry by default. --agent selects source Agents and --session selects
exact source session references. Without --to, each session returns to its source Agent;
with --to, every selected session is restored or projected to that Agent. In a terminal,
omit the file to choose a .agenthist file from the current directory. Omitting --dry-run
and --apply opens the import guide for browsing, previewing, selecting,
mapping, planning, and one final confirmation. --dry-run plans without writing and --apply
executes after the same full preflight; scripts and --json require an explicit file and mode.
The interactive guide follows the terminal locale, can switch languages with l, and accepts
--language for an explicit English or Chinese start. Non-interactive output remains English.
Repeated identical imports do not create duplicate conversations. Codex history binds to
the target's current provider unless --codex-provider says otherwise.
Without --map-path, source workspace paths remain unchanged only when source and target use
the same path style. POSIX/Windows transfers require an explicit mapping. Every selected Agent's
final workspace must exist so restored sessions remain visible in its normal workspace view.
Every path decision is shown before the session summary.
Degraded routes report their known findings and may be applied; blocked routes return nonzero
and write nothing. JSON includes complete route, session, workspace, resource, and transaction results.
`,
  codex: `Usage:
  agenthist codex provider list
  agenthist codex provider unify [--to <current|provider-id>] (--dry-run|--apply)

Inspect or rebind provider identifiers stored in Codex history. Rebinding changes history
visibility only; it never migrates Base URLs, API keys, tokens, OAuth, or connection settings.
The target defaults to the built-in openai provider when --to is omitted.
`,
  transaction: `Usage:
  agenthist transaction list
  agenthist transaction rollback <transaction-ref> (--dry-run|--apply)
  agenthist transaction recover <transaction-ref> (--dry-run|--apply)

Inspect and safely finish or undo native history writes. Rollback and recover always require
an explicit execution mode.
`,
  gc: `Usage:
  agenthist gc [--dry-run]

Remove garbage inside the AgentHist state directory: interrupted snapshot workspaces
(.prepare-*) and published snapshots no longer referenced by the history head, pending
transactions, or the transaction store. Native Agent history is never touched. The default
applies the cleanup; --dry-run only reports reclaimable entries and bytes. Cleanup always
skips entries retained by unfinished transactions.
`,
  help: `Usage:
  agenthist help [command]
  agenthist <command> --help

Show root help or concise help for one public command.
`,
  version: `Usage:
  agenthist version
  agenthist --version

Show the AgentHist version.
